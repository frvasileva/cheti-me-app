        "Stuff Dutch People Like is a bestselling, humorous cultural study of the Netherlands and its peculiar inhabitants. It investigates and highlights the idiosyncrasies of the Dutch, their culture and their uncanny ability to talk on a mobile phone while carrying 2.5 children, 6 bags of groceries and a mattress balanced on a gear-less bicycle. This book is a must read for: 1) People with Dutch ancestry wondering why they are so strange. / 2) Anybody who wants to survive their next trip to Amsterdam or Holland / 3) People with a Dutch partner who will finally understand that all their relationship issues can be boiled down to one fact: Their partner is Dutch!",
